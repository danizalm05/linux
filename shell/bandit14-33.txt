ssh bandit13@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
pass 8ZjyCRiBWFYkneahHwxCv3wb2a1ORpYL

problem: Password stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14
and can only be read by user bandit14.
For this level, you don’t get the next password, but you get
a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level.
Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on

So we need to use ssh to login to another users account:
bandit14@localhost for us.

solution:
1. ls
output: A file sshkey.private. This is a private ssh key
2. cat sshkey.private
3. ssh -i ./sshkey.private bandit14@localhost
4. print yes to question are you sure
5. Now we are login as bandit14
6. cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14
pass = 4wcYUJFw0k0XLShlDzztnTBHiqxU3b3e

ssh bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
pass: y

problem:password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30000 on localhost.


solution: 1.  echo 4wcYUJFw0k0XLShlDzztnTBHiqxU3b3e | nc localhost 30000

   problem:  Password can be retrieved by submitting password of the current level to port 30001 on localhost using SSL encryption

 
   solution: 1. echo BfMYroe26WYalil77FoDi9qh59eK5xNr | openssl s_client -quiet -connect localhost:30001  
  
   Anoter solution: cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit15 | openssl s_client -quiet -connect localhost:30001
  
     output :
         depth=0 CN = localhost

         verify return:1
         depth=0 CN = localhost
         verify return:1
         Correct!
